        The Zaraster calendar is a calendar popularized by an ancient civilisation which remains in use long after its fall. It has 12 months, with 30 days each, for 360 days in a year. The seasons tied to each are based on the northern hemisphere of a standard planet, so the southern hemisphere would experience the reversal. The year starts with the first month of spring.
